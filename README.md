This project was made for the AI of God Hackathon in IIT (ISM) Dhanbad

1)The project contains the hackathon notebook through which the model was trained
https://github.com/ghatotkachhh/Meteor-Crator-Image-Classifier/blob/main/notebook85de56f19a.ipynb

2)The weights of the model will be saved 

3)Load the weights of the trained model and use the detect.ipynp file to detect

4)To use the model to do the classification use the detect.ipynb file run it where by giving the image location in the parameter of the function
https://github.com/ghatotkachhh/Meteor-Crator-Image-Classifier/blob/main/detect.ipynb

5)The result will give you the class of the meteor

we will deply the model soon
